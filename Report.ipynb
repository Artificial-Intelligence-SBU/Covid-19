        "On March 11, the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) declared Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic characterized by the rapid and global spread of the novel coronavirus around the world. As governments scramble to close borders, implement contact tracing, and increase awareness of personal hygiene in an effort to contain the spread of the virus, the spread of the virus is still unfortunately expected to increase until a vaccine can be developed and deployed owing to different standards of implementing these policies for each country.</br>The outbreak of coronavirus started since December 2019 in Wuhan and surprised everyone with its rapid spread. This virus widespread human-to-human transmission has resulted in 9,079,748 cases in the world with 471,289 deaths up to January 21, 2020.\n"
